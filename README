Next steps:
Improve the form. 	


What's left atm?
-Form
	o locations - get token fields decent
	o tf form - get token fields decent
		-deal with dates that normally only need 1 time frame (i.e. 2 identical time keys)
		-make time key definition in separate time frames area
	o Get the time frames' past data to be saved to the next form... really, make repeated memory creation easy.

-Index
	o Make it engaging / interesting. Categorization => understanding. Show time frames of memories.
	
Pretend I need to show this today.
	
Remember. This must allow people to easily tell their stories.












Later:
