Next steps:
Improve the form. 	


What's left atm?
-Form
	o tf form:
		-deal with dates that normally only need 1 time frame (i.e. 2 identical time keys)
	o Get the time frames' past data to be saved to the next form... really, make repeated memory creation easy.
-Index
	o Make it engaging / interesting.
	
Pretend I need to show this today.
	
Remember. This must allow people to easily tell their stories.












Later:
fix days lived in index.js.coffee to specific user

Note: none of the view specs are implemented.
